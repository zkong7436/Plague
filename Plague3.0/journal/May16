I worked on the disease screens
I started the button subclass which will change the background color based on which page is opened

next time I hope I can have the button finished

I've also encountered a problem: I couldn't use setScreen in the Upgrades class, probably because PlagueS is in another package

I was working on the button, tried to make it change background color when clicked instead of hovering

I couldn't made the setScreen work because PlagueS is in another folder
set font color

I worked on the transmission rate because Wendy needs it
I helped Wendy to make the state button change color based on infected rate
Joseph also struggled to make his code work

Today I worked on my own part. I've encountered some minor issues, such as printing a new line.

Right now I'm trying to get all the images and description stuff up so I can work on the next part which cooperates
with the Wendy;s and Ivan's code.

I tried to help Wendy to resolve her issues but I don't know how.
I plan to redo the color changing part so it changes the lightness based on the infected percentage.

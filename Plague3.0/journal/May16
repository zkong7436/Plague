I worked on the Upgrade abstract class. 
Next time I hope I can finish it so I can move on to transmissions

I worked on the disease screens
I started the button subclass which will change the background color based on which page is opened

next time I hope I can have the button finished

I've also encountered a problem: I couldn't use setScreen in the Upgrades class, probably because PlagueS is in another package

I was working on the button, tried to make it change background color when clicked instead of hovering

I couldn't made the setScreen work because PlagueS is in another folder
set font color

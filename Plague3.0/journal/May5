What I've accomplished today:
	- Made progress in planning
	- Started coding for State class
		- Climate
		- Region
		- To be more efficient in creating the ArrayList of states, I'll use the method that I used in Pokemon project
	- New members joined
	
Goal for next day:
	- start coding for specific features like transmissions
	- come up algorithm to calculate spread rate
	- find out how to show infection progress in a state

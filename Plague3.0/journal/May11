What I've done today:
	- Tried to organize what we are doing
	- created PlagueS game class
	- we are going to create an abstract class because the transmissions, symptom, and abilities screens 
		look similar, they will have the same style.

Issues came up:
	- how do we present the map
	
Goal for next time:
	- have the main screen working
